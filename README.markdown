This was an ill-conceived idea, for many reasons.

One was the name itself, which was a very poor choice.

More importantly, it was basically trying to replicate something like YAML.

Well, actually that's not true. It was trying to be more generic than that. But whatever I had in mind
when I started this project I ultimately abandoned because it could easily be achieved with YAML or
something like it. So there you have it.

I will leave it here, for posterity.
